# HackTheBox: Fluffy â€“ Writeup
Fluffy is an easy Windows machine, vulnerable to CVE-2025-24071 allowing us to obtain the NTLM hash of a user listening on the system, after which a vulnerable ESC16 certificate is found, enabling the attacker to gain the administrators hash.

**NOTE:** The `KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW` (Clock Skew Too Great) error in Kerberos occurs when your system time differs significantly from the target machine. To fix this, you can synchronize your clock with the target using tools like `rdate` or adjust your system time manually. This ensures Kerberos tickets are accepted, preventing authentication errors during operations like Kerberoasting. For a detailed guide, see [this article](https://medium.com/@danieldantebarnes/fixing-the-kerberos-sessionerror-krb-ap-err-skew-clock-skew-too-great-issue-while-kerberoasting-b60b0fe20069).

### File shared enumeration

Using the provided confidential provided, I am able look into the files shared via SMB.

Which includes a pdf file, containing the number of vulnerabilities in the machine.

## Initial foothold

Amongst which upon researching, CVE-2025-24071 has an exploit, that enables us to obtain the NTLM hash of the current user on the machine. The exploit can be found [here](https://github.com/DeshanFer94/CVE-2025-24071-POC-NTLMHashDisclosure-/tree/main/POC).

![Image Alt](https://github.com/mfahdk/Writeups/blob/main/HackTheBox/Fluffy/Screenshots/3.png)

The NTLM responder is opened on the machine using the command `sudo responder -i tun0`.

And then the hash is cracked using john.

![Image Alt](https://github.com/mfahdk/Writeups/blob/main/HackTheBox/Fluffy/Screenshots/6.png)

The bloodhound data is obtained using bloodhound-python, using the user 'p.agila' using the command `bloodhound-python -u p.agila -p 'prometheusx-303' -ns 10.10.11.69 -d fluffy.htb -c all
`.

### Shadow credential attack

Upon adding the obtained AD data to bloodhound, we see that agila is a member of service account managers, and has DACL GenericAll rights over service accounts, which is responsible for WinRM and CA. Our aim is to enable us to WinRM using agila's account, which is currently disabled. In order to do so, follow the commands instructed by bloodhound (on the right pane). 

![Image Alt](https://github.com/mfahdk/Writeups/blob/main/HackTheBox/Fluffy/Screenshots/8.png)

`Note: Adding the user to service account won't be permanent due to GPO' we can verify if agila is now part of service accounts.

![Image Alt](https://github.com/mfahdk/Writeups/blob/main/HackTheBox/Fluffy/Screenshots/9.png)

After Agila is added to Service Accounts, it gains GenericWrite over the WINRM_SVC account. This allows us to use Certipy to perform a Shadow Credentials attack, appending our own public key to the msDS-KeyCredentialLink attribute. As a result, we can authenticate as the WINRM_SVC user without knowing its password.

Allowing us to winrm into the user, using the hash and obtain the user flag.

## Privilege escalation

We then perform the same shadow credentials attack on the CA service account, to look for any misconfigured AD CS.

![Image Alt](https://github.com/mfahdk/Writeups/blob/main/HackTheBox/Fluffy/Screenshots/13.png)

After which we use certipy-ad to look for any vulnerable AD certificates, and come across ESC16.

![Image Alt](https://github.com/mfahdk/Writeups/blob/main/HackTheBox/Fluffy/Screenshots/14.png)

The exploit for ESC16 can be found [here](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy/wiki/06-%E2%80%90-Privilege-Escalation#esc16-security-extension-disabled-on-ca-globally)

After following the steps, we're able to gain access to the administrator and obtain the root flag.
