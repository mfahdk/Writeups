## 📘 HTB Writeups Policy

Welcome to my Hack The Box (HTB) writeup repository!

🛡️ **Important Notice**  
In accordance with HTB's disclosure policy, **writeups are only published for retired machines** to avoid spoiling active challenges or violating platform rules.

🧠 Each writeup will be released **after the machine is officially retired** by Hack The Box.  
🔐 Active machine solutions will never be posted or shared publicly.

💬 If you're interested in a particular writeup that hasn’t been published yet, feel free to reach out — I’ll let you know once it’s safe and available.

Thanks for understanding, and happy hacking! 👾
